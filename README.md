## Lecture: Machine Learning for Data Science (ML4DS)
ML4DS lecture @FUB during WiSe21/22

### About the lecture
The course provides an overview of machine learning methods and algorithms for different learning tasks, namely supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.
In the *first part* of the course, for each task the main algorithms and techniques will be covered including experimentation and evaluation aspects.
In the *second part* of the course, we will focus on specific learning challenges including high-dimensionality, non-stationarity, label-scarcity and class-imbalance.
By the end of the course, you will have learned how to build machine learning models for different problems, how to properly evaluate their performance and how to tackle specific learning challenges.
